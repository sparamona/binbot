### Example Session

```
ðŸ¤– BinBot CLI Frontend
==============================
âœ… Session started: a1b2c3d4...
Type '/help' for commands or '/quit' to exit

ðŸ”§ > /help

ðŸ“‹ BinBot CLI Commands:
  /help                     - Show this help message

  /quit, /exit, /q          - Exit the application
  <any text>                - Send command to BinBot

ðŸ’¡ Examples:
  add screwdriver to bin A
  what's in bin B?
  /upload photo.jpg
  search for red items

ðŸ”§ > what bins do I have?
ðŸ¤– You currently have no bins set up. Would you like me to help you create some bins?

ðŸ”§ > create bin A for tools
ðŸ¤– I've created bin A for storing tools. You can now add items to this bin.

ðŸ”§ > /upload test/coaster_pen_mouse.jpg
ðŸ“¸ Image uploaded successfully
ðŸ¤– I've analyzed the image and found 3 items: wooden coaster, red pen, and Logitech mouse.

ðŸ”§ > what's in bin A?
ðŸ¤– Bin A (tools) contains:

## Configuration

### API Server URL

By default, the CLI connects to `http://localhost:8000`. You can change this by:

1. **Environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export BINBOT_API_URL=http://your-server:8000
   python frontend/cli.py
   ```

2. **Command line argument:**
   ```bash
   python frontend/cli.py http://your-server:8000
   ```

## Error Handling

The CLI handles common errors gracefully:

- **Connection errors**: Shows clear error messages if the API server is not running
- **File not found**: Validates image file paths before upload
- **API errors**: Displays server error messages
- **Keyboard interrupts**: Clean exit with Ctrl+C
- **Session cleanup**: Automatically ends sessions on exit

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library (included in requirements.txt)
- Running BinBot API server

## Implementation Details

- **Session Management**: Creates a new session on startup and cleans up on exit
- **HTTP Requests**: Uses the `requests` library to communicate with the API
- **File Uploads**: Handles multipart form data for image uploads
- **Cookie Handling**: Manages session cookies for API authentication
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network and API errors
